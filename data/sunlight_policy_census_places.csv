Snipes, Assistant City Manager</p><p>DATE: August 26, 2013</p><p>SUBJECT: City of Austin Open Government Directive</p><p>The City of Austin is fully committed to transparency, efficiency, collaboration, and an Open Government. As such, the City Manager and staff are developing new and innovative strategies to engage our city's talented high-tech community and to make our internal processes more effective.</p><p>Per Council Resolution No. 20111208-074, Council directed that the City Manager develop an Open Government Framework to address the following:</p><p>1.  Open Data</p><p>2.  Open Source Platforms</p><p>3.  Mobile applications</p><p>4.  Social media.</p><p>Under the City Manager's leadership, staff has diligently worked to execute those directives making significant progress including the publication of the award-winning City of Austin's Data Portal which includes over 60 datasets, 11 charts, and 18 interactive maps.</p><p>This memo serves to take yet another step toward our goals for Open Government in releasing the City of Austin Open Government Directive. This Directive outlines specific steps for City Departments to achieve the goal of creating a more open government, increasing public trust, and establishing a system of public participation, collaboration, and accountability.</p><p>I will provide further updates on staff's progress on the Open Government initiative during the August 28, 2013 Audit and Finance Committee meeting.</p><p>Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p><h2>City of Austin Open Government Directive</h2><p>Introduction</p><p>With the development of new technologies and an increasingly connected and engaged population, a growing expectation has been placed on the City of Austin government leaders to adopt open government practices that will promote transparency, citizen participation, and collaboration. In order to change how government works, provide more effective government services, and establish a more robust democracy, the City of Austin adopts the following open government principles:</p><p>·         The City of Austin is committed to transparency. The City of Austin should adopt policies, practices, and procedures that allow citizens to have access to understandable, accurate, reusable, and auditable data and information about government operations and decision-making (with updates available as they are made, whenever possible). City departments should use new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online. Departments should also seek public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public. The City should operate under a presumption of openness and accessibility, while also maintaining privacy, confidentiality, security and compliance with all relevant laws. These policies, practices, and procedures will increase accountability, promote informed public participation, and create economic development opportunities.</p><p>·         The City of Austin is committed to meaningful public participation. The City of Austin believes members of the public have a valuable role in governing their communities and should have opportunities to take part in government decision-making. The City of Austin supports establishing guidelines and practices that will enable the public to contribute opinions and ideas regarding political, economic, management, and other decisions using a variety of methods, as conveniently as possible for citizens. These guidelines and practices will create more informed and effective policies and enhance and expand opportunities for the public to participate throughout decision-making processes.</p><p>·         The City of Austin is committed to <span class=g-goals-and-values>collaborating with the public and across government</span>. The City of Austin should create opportunities to work jointly with individuals as well as public, non­profit, academic, and private sector groups to address the needs of the community. The City should also enhance and expand its cooperation among City departments and other governmental agencies in order to more effectively fulfill the City's obligations to citizens. Furthermore, citizens are encouraged to contribute their time and knowledge. The City will take steps to provide efficient and effective methods of participating and collaborating, and the City commits to incorporating citizen feedback into decision-making processes.</p><p>·         The City of Austin is committed to <span class=g-goals-and-values>sharing best practices and software and other resources with other government entities</span>.</p><p>The City of Austin acknowledges that, in the face of budget decreases, government entities at every level must cut costs and find efficiencies. An enormous cost-saving opportunity exists in the City's information technology resource acquisition practices. The City of Austin supports collaborating with other government entities to share technology resources, lessons learned, and best practices; reform procurement practices, policies, and procedures; and learn to function not only as a provider of services but as a source for other government entities, the public, and other organizations to add value to the City's services.</p><p>·         Open Government Directive: <span class=g-binding-regulations>These commitments require that the City create a legal framework that will institutionalize the principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration into the culture and work of The City of Austin government. Therefore, the City Manager shall establish within [90 days] an Open Government Directive to guide the implementation of open government.</span></p><p>The City of Austin is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government. <span class=g-public-participation>City officials will work together and with the public to ensure open and effective government as well as public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, collaboration, and accountability.</span></p><p>This memorandum requires The City of Austin departments and agencies to take the following steps to achieve the goal of creating a more open government:</p><p>1. Publish Government Information Online</p><p>To increase accountability, promote informed public participation, and create economic development opportunities, each Department shall expand access to information by making it available online in open formats that facilitate access to and reuse of information.</p><p>a.

Open Data Catalog: <span class=g-lists-of-holdings>Within [60] days, each Department shall create a catalog of its public information. The catalog will be accessible through the City's Open Government Web page. The catalog will indicate:</span></p><p>i.         <span class=g-lists-of-holdings>If the information is publicly-accessible;</span></p><p>ii.        <span class=g-lists-of-holdings>The date of when the information was made publicly-accessible</span>;</p><p>iii.      <span class=g-lists-of-holdings>The date the information was last updated</span>;</p><p>iv.      <span class=g-lists-of-holdings>If the information is from a primary source or has been aggregated or modified; </span>and</p><p>v.        <span class=g-lists-of-holdings>If the information is restricted by any license or privacy restrictions.</span></p><p>g.

Publication of Open Records Requests: Each Department shall publish each Texas Public Information Act request in an open format on the Open Government Web page, unless the request is subject to valid privacy, security, or privilege limitations. The name of the requester will remain anonymous unless otherwise indicated by the requester. If a request is subject to limitation, the Department should release a redacted version of the request that also discloses the nature of the request. Each open records request shall be listed in conjunction with the status of the request and whether such request has been fulfilled. Where practicable, the requested information should be released to the public in an open format and published on the Open Government Web page.[5] This action should be fulfilled following a 10 business day buffer period to allow appropriate vetting of the request prior to publishing.</p><p>k. Licenses: <span class=g-open-access><span class=g-license-free>The City shall not assert any copyright, patent, trademark, or other restriction on government information. However, such restrictions may be applied to information shared by the City that was compiled or modified by non-governmental entities or individuals</span></span>.[6]</p><p>2. Create and Institutionalize a Culture of Open Government</p><p>To support open government and government accountability the City of Austin will expand and create opportunities for citizen participation and collaboration.</p><p>a. Open Government Plans: Within 120 days, each the City of Austin shall develop and publish an Open Government Plan that will describe how the each department will enhance and develop transparency, public participation, and collaboration.</p><p>i.

The City shall release the evaluation on </span><span class=g-public-participation><span class=g-future-review>the Open Government Web page o</span>r create an Open Government Dashboard that will provide the public with both graphic and narrative evaluation information. </span>The evaluation will indicate if the City has not satisfied, partially satisfied, or fully satisfied the following criteria:</p><p>i.            Experts and other stakeholders were consulted when creating the Open Government Plan;</p><p>ii.           The public was involved in developing the Open Government Plan;</p><p>iii.

The City has established processes to revise its Open Government Plan to reflect changing public needs and new technologies.</p><p>c. Open Government <span class=g-oversight-authority>Operating Board: Within [45] days, the City Manager shall establish an</span></p><p><span class=g-oversight-authority>operating board that focuses on transparency, accountability, public participation, and</span></p><p><span class=g-oversight-authority>collaboration within the City of Austin government. This group, with senior level representation from program and management offices throughout the City of Austin, will serve several critical functions, including</span>:</p><p>i.          Transparency Forum: The operating board will provide a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote transparency, including system and process solutions for information collection, aggregation, validation, and dissemination. In particular, the board will govern the City of Austin open data initiative and direct Department participation.</p><p>ii.        Participation and Collaboration Forum: The working group will provide a forum to share best practices on innovative ideas to promote participation and collaboration, including how to experiment with new technologies, take advantage of the expertise and insight of people both inside and outside the City of Austin government, and form high impact collaborations with researchers, the private sector, and the public.</p><p>iii.                  	Public Input Forum: The working group will provide a forum for developing</p><p>resolutions to issues described through the public feedback mechanisms of the Open Government Web page.</p><p>d. Incentives: <span class=g-funding>Within 90 days, the Chief Financial Officer will issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance (such as the Open Government Operating Board), a framework for how the City of Austin can </span>use challenges, prizes, and other incentive-backed strategies to find innovative or cost-effective solutions to improving open government.</p><p>3. Utilize Accessible and Emerging Technology/Tools</p><p><span class=g-open-code>Departments, in coordination with the City of Austin Communication Technology Management department and Purchasing Office, should seek opportunities to utilize new and emerging technologies, whenever possible, to make software solutions available to as many users as possible. Utilizing Open Source software/platforms, web (browser based) applications for mobile devices and Agile project methodologies, offers departments great potential to deliver quality software applications that are accessible, scalable, flexible, shareable/reusable and reflect common tools and practices used to innovate in private industry.</span></p><p>a.     Open Source Software/Platforms (OSS): The Open Government Plan will include formal plans to utilize Open Source software/platforms when applicable. OSS solutions should be included for consideration in any software procurement or development strategy. Utilizing OSS opens opportunities for community participation, application sharing across agencies/governments and potential cost savings/ROI.</p><p>b.     Mobile Application Development: To keep pace with the growing amount of internet users utilizing mobile devices (phone, tablets, etc.), Departments should seek to provide platform independent software applications when applicable and fit within the City of Austin's overall mobile strategy.</p> <p/> <p>c. 	Agile Project Management: In an effort to keep pace with the fast moving world of technology and to more readily respond to changing requirements, the City of Austin should utilize Agile Project Management methodologies whenever possible. These methodologies allow the flexibility for software development projects to adjust to customer requirements</p><p>d. 	Procurement: <span class=g-open-code>Within [90] days the Purchasing Officer will include in standard Request for Proposal (RFP) documentation, language requiring the examination of at least one Open Source solution for all software application purchases.</span> In addition, language related to software vendors being able to provide mobile ready versions of their products, will be required to meet the City of Austin's mobile application strategy.</p><p>4. Create an Enabling Policy Framework for Open Government</p><p>Emerging technologies open new forms of communication between government and the public. Achieving a more open government will require the various professional disciplines within the government (such as policy, legal, procurement, finance, and technology operations) to work together to define and develop open government solutions. Policies should be regularly reviewed and revised to realize the potential of technology for open government.</p><p>a.   	Identification of Barriers, Guidance, and Revisions: Within 120 days, the City Attorney, in consultation with the City's Chief Information Officer, will review existing The City of Austin policies to identify impediments to open government and to the use of new technologies and, where necessary, issue clarifying guidance and/or propose revisions to such policies, to promote greater openness in government.</p><p>b.   	Publication of Guidance and Proposed Policy Changes: Any clarifying guidance and/or proposed policies related to this Open Government Directive will be available through the City's Open Government Web page.</p> <p/> <p>Notes:</p><p>[1]    The timely and consistent publication of government information is of critical importance to the use of that information. Adherence to a publication schedule is critical to the success of this open government mandate. It is not enough to simply publish information without managing that information. Therefore, it is important that the mayor or another executive leader or leaders to review the resources necessary to manage the on-going publication effort, but the directive should not eliminate the schedule as part of a publication plan.</p><p>[2]    Paragraph c is intended to embody the underlying intent of Freedom of Information/Open Records laws in that information held and maintained by the government is public information. As such, the default setting must be to release information and publication should only be withheld if a valid privacy, security, or privilege exists. A valid privacy, security, or privilege concerns include, but are not limited to, personal identifying information, critical infrastructure information, information related to an on­going criminal investigation, or any publication that may breach an individual or groups legal rights. If the local government chooses to withhold information from publication that government entity should provide the public with a reasonably detailed explanation for withholding the information. Such explanation should be created to foster trust and instill transparency in the publication process. Furthermore, in order to provide consistent application the City's council should provide detailed guidelines regarding the limited publication exemptions.</p><p>[3]    One of the greatest strains on government resources is compliance with open records requests. As such, local governments should use the open government directive as an opportunity to preemptively publish government information before an open records request is received. Furthermore, the local government should publish information if such information is frequently requested or if the information is a data set.</p><p>[4]    Paragraph d is intended to result in the maximum use of government information. Governments must publish information that is machine-readable as well as human-readable. Although maximum openness is achieved through publication in open formats, City's should take steps to publish what information they have in whatever format they have and then take steps to convert that information into open formats.</p><p>[5]  Government information includes data sets collected and maintained by the local government. Dissemination of these data sets is as important as all other forms of publication. Therefore, local government should actively release this data to the public for use and re-use. It is again critical that data be released in an open format that is machine readable and accessible.</p><p>[6]  Unlike US Federal Government information, state and local government information is not in the public domain as a matter of law unless the state or local law dictates otherwise. Some local governments can and do exercise copy, trade, and intellectual property rights over government information. This practice significantly impacts the use of government information by the public and hinders open government efforts. Local governments should, therefore, release all government information free of any such right and should not exercise these rights after release. However, the City may reserve the right to enforce reasonable privacy, security, and privilege rights on government information. Finally, if license or restrictions are asserted then the license and restriction should be minimally restrictive so that they do not significantly impugn the use and derivative use of the information</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Open Data Handbook (http://opendatahandbook.org/en/)</p><p>Open Government Initiative (http://opengovernmentinitiative.org/)</p> <p/>"

Minimize limitations on the disclosure of public information while appropriately safeguarding protected and sensitive information;6. Support innovative uses of the City-Parish’s publishable data by agencies, the public, and other partners;7. Encourage electronic methods of data collection to avoid inefficiencies of paper-based filing systems and make real-time disclosures possible;8. Include specifications in future Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and comparable procurements to encourage technology solutions with an open source licensing model and/or the capabilities to store and expose public data using industry standard and open protocols, including language that allows for modifying these systems over time to maintain up-to-date data documentation;9. In coordination with the Office of the Parish Attorney, publicly log and publish all approved or denied public record requests and associated details pursuant to the Louisiana Public Records Act (La. R.S. 44:1 et seq); and10. Develop contract provisions that promote the City-Parish’s open data policies in technology-related procurements, including, where appropriate, requirements that any data produced or stored on behalf of the City-Parish may be posted on the City-Parish open data portal or made available through other means..### Part 2: DefinitionsA. “Data” means statistical, factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that is maintained or created by or on behalf of a City-Parish agency.

Implement to the extent possible, open standards related to data formats, interoperability, structure, and common identifiers when collecting and publishing data.2.      **We focus on publishing high quality and high value data sets** — We release high quality, high value data sets which are accurate, timely, up to date, and adequately documented following internationally agreed upon standards, metadata and classifiers.3.      **We administer the open data program with a bias for open** — We encourage government data is made open by default, while recognizing that there are legitimate reasons why some data cannot be released.These principles have been inspired by the Sunlight Foundation and by the G8 Summit, including the U.S., hosted by the United Kingdom in July 2013. The “Open Data Charter” was agreed to during the Summit, based on the principles that government data should be open by default, of high quality and increasing quantity, openly licensed and provided in open formats with the purpose of improving governance and spurring innovation.Underlying these principles is the Public Records Act (Chapter 42.56RCW) and the City’s Public Records Act Rules (http://www.bellevuewa.gov/pdf/Clerk/Bellevue_Public_Records_Act_Rules.pdf) which define public records and guarantees access to certain categories of government information.These principles will be supported in the City of Bellevue with ongoing program governance and policies.## Bellevue Open Data Policy### PurposeThis Management Policy establishes guidelines for the City of Bellevue’s open data program. Through the adoption of this policy, Bellevue commits to using open data to advance certain city goals, including enhancing the public’s access to information, improving governance and service delivery, promoting government transparency and accountability, and furthering public engagement and collaboration with government data to promote innovation and drive economic activity. The Policy lays out a formal structure for the open data initiative, including details related to the governance structure, prioritization of data release, online platform for release of data, and a process for reviewing and reporting on program progress.### ScopeThis management policy applies to all city departments, as well as the records of third party contractors that create data on behalf of a city department.### Program Goals1.

Financially sound City providing quality basic services.</p><p><strong>STRATEGIC PLAN SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> Objective 1c. Engaged residents that are well informed and involved in an open governance process.</p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The Illinois Policy Institute has developed a Ten-Point Transparency Checklist to help provide a “best practices” framework to improve government transparency across the State of Illinois. This Checklist encourages the following information to be provided on a public body’s website: (1) Elected  Administrative Officials: Contact Information; (2) Meeting Information: Calendar (Future) Minutes  Board Packets (Past); (3) Public Records: FOIA submission  FOIA Officer Contact Information; (4) Budgets: General and Special Projects; (5) Financial Audits: Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports; (6) Expenditures: Bills  Payroll; (7) Salary  Benefits: Wages, Salary, Overtime, Health, Dental, Life, Pension, etc.; (8) Contracts: Union, Private Contractors, Vendors, Council Contract; (9) Lobbying: TaxpayerFunded Lobbying Associations; and (10) Taxes  Fees: Sales, Property, Income, and Miscellaneous Taxes, Non-proprietary in excess of $25,000.</p><p>The City is committed to transparency in the conduct of the public’s business. It should be noted that in 2013, Bloomington was one (1) of only fifty (50) of the nearly 7,000 communities in Illinois to earn the Illinois Policy Institute’s Sunshine Award for outstanding online transparency performance. Upon final audit, Bloomington earned 88.7 points out of 100, an improvement of thirty (30) points over the City’s first audit score, and finished in ninth place overall for web transparency in the State of Illinois.</p><p>City staff has modeled a Website Transparency Policy based off the Illinois Policy Institute’s checklist. This Policy was previously reviewed by the Council at a Committee of the Whole meeting at which time there was a desire communicated to have it adopted by Ordinance as opposed by Resolution and to make sure that City staff had sufficient time to implement the changes set forth within the Policy. The Resolution has now been modified into an Ordinance and the Policy itself has been updated to provide further clarification on some of the issues and ensure staff has sufficient time to implement the changes. </p><p>As opposed to a September 1, 2014 start date, the Policy now calls for implementation effective October 1, 2014. The new version of the Policy also has a standard five (5) year retention policy for all documents. Clarification within the Policy was also made on the requirement that executed contracts, entered into by the Council on or after October 1, 2014, will be placed on the City’s website. It is staff’s intent that once these contracts are executed by all parties, they will be scanned and placed in the appropriate folder on the website. Older contracts will be scanned and placed on the website as resources allow. The revised Policy also clarifies that information on construction and building permits and application fees, along with written applications, will be available on the website. Other permits, fees and applications will be added and provided as available. </p><p>The transparency portal on the City’s website will be updated as a result of this Policy to coordinate with the ten (10) areas it outlines. Links will be provided under each category to obtain the information described within the Policy. A large majority of the information detailed within the Policy is already on the website and in many cases the City will be exceeding the Policy’s written standards. Staff is hopeful that by adding even more information to the website and clarifying where documents can be found, there will be a reduction in FOIA requests.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY GROUPS/INTERESTED PERSONS CONTACTED:</strong> This Policy was drafted based on recommendations from the Illinois Public Policy Institute.</p><p><strong>FINANCIAL IMPACT:</strong> Not applicable.</p><p>Respectfully submitted for Council consideration.</p><p>Prepared by: Jeffrey R.

Content may be Incorporated by Reference from External Content or from other sections internal to the Data Policy.

Walsh on April 7th, 2014.  That order authorizes and directs the Chief Information Officer (CIO) to issue and maintain policies covering Open Data and Protected Data including Identity and Access Management guidelines for Sharing Protected Data.  ### 1.4 Definition of DataData is to be treated as an important resource of the City of Boston and its constituents for strategic and operational purposes, among others. For the purposes of this policy, data is defined as geospatial, tabular, textual, legislative and source code that is maintained in an electronic, digital or optical format.  ### 1.5 Policy Construction and InterpretationNothing in this Data Policy shall be construed to diminish or alter the rights or obligations afforded under the Massachusetts Public Records Law, Chapter 66, Section 10 of the Massachusetts General Laws and the exemptions under Chapter 4, Section 7(26).  Additionally, this Data Policy is intended to be interpreted consistent with Federal, Commonwealth, and local laws and regulations regarding the privacy, confidentiality, and security of data.  Nothing herein shall authorize the disclosure of data that is exempt, for reasons such as confidentiality or privacy, or otherwise legally protected unless such disclosure is authorized by law and approved by the Corporation Counsel of the City of Boston.## 2.0 Data Management*Q. How is data indexed?*A. The City will maintain a Data Catalog, which serves as a registry of the City’s data sets and includes key information documentation about the data, including whether it is considered Public Record.*Q. What is Data Classification?*A. Data Classification is the process of determining which data sets are Public Records and which sets are Exempt Records according to Chapter 66, Section 10 and Chapter 4, Section 7(26) of Massachusetts General Laws.  *Q. What is a Data Classification Label?*A. A Data Classification Label is the quick way to check if any restrictions apply to disclosure or use of data.  There are two main labels: The Public Record or Exempt Record labels. A label may change over time due to changes in law, the use of analytics or the combination of other data, for example.   *Q. Does a Data Classification Label change?*A.  How a specific data set is labeled may change for a number of reasons including a change to law or new data analysis.  For example, data that, itself, may not contain personally identifiable information may reveal such information when combined with other data sets.  *Q. Who has rights to data generated through a private contract?*A. The City has numerous contracts with private companies to facilitate City operations such as applying for building permits..  Unless specified otherwise in a contract, the City of Boston has the exclusive right to share, store or dispose of data created through these contracts.  The City will seek to include standard language in all contracts that ensure these rights.  ### 2.1 Data CatalogTo manage the City’s data, the Chief Information Officer and the CIO’s designee shall establish and maintain a Data Catalog.  That data catalog will be a register of data sets, including information such as their location, description, classification, custodianship, security controls or other stipulations, where applicable.  ### 2.2 Data ClassificationData of the City of Boston will be classified as a either a Public Record or an Exempt Record according to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66, Section 10 and Chapter 4, Section 7(26) . The CIO will work with the City’s Law Department and the relevant departments who are closest to each data set to conduct this data classification.  The data sets will be labeled in the Data Catalog according to their classification. ### 2.3 Impact of Data Analysis & Data ScienceThe CIO or the CIO’s designee will regularly review the catalog and work with the relevant Departments to ensure that classifications labels are appropriately up to date.  The classification of data as an Exempt Record or as a Public Record may change after analytics or other computational processing are conducted on data. ### 2.4 Rights to Share, Store and Dispose of DataIn some cases, the City will enter into contracts with third parties for the provision of public services, through which new data will be generated.  In these cases, the City’s default position is that the City - and not third party acting on behalf of the City - has the exclusive right to share, store or dispose of data, to the extent allowed by law.   The City of Boston Model Data Contract, which is hereby Incorporated by Reference, includes specific standard contract language.## 3.0 Open Data Policy*Q. What is Open Data?*A.

This is also known as Exempt Data.### 4.2 Securing Exempt DataThe CIO will establish and maintain a comprehensive data security program in compliance with best practices and applicable law.  This program will help safeguard data from threats to confidentiality, integrity and availability. This program is outlined in the City of Boston Protected Data Security Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference.  Departments shall adhere to the provisions of the Protected Data Security Policy, including with respect to security and other controls to safeguard Protected Data; use of Identity and Access Management; and good practice guidelines for compliance with legal or other rules requiring the sharing of Protected Data with authorized parties upon the grant of consent, by operation of law or when otherwise so required.### 4.3 Sharing Protected Data	The CIO and his designee, in consultation with departments, can choose to share protected data to specific City partners for the limited reasons of program evaluation, research, analysis or other public good purposes.

The City of Charlottesville encourages an open and transparent government by using open data to improve citizen engagement, promote civic innovation, engage community problem solving.2. The City places a priority on providing open data sets that help the City achieve its mission and goals.3. The City will strive for proactive disclosure, in accordance with existing open data laws.4. The City will respond to new data set requests while considering available staff and financial resources.5. The City will collect and publish data that is accessible to all users, published in a machine readable format, and broad and non-discriminatory.### I. PURPOSE AND POLICY STATEMENTThe purpose of this Management Policy is to establish guidelines for the City of Charlottesville Open Data Initiative. The City of Charlottesville is committed to creating a formal Open Data program that includes the creation of an Open Data Web Portal where machine-readable data will be publicly available online. The initiative is intended to advance a number of public policy objectives, including:- Increased transparency and access to public information- Enhanced coordination and efficiencies among City departments and partner organizations- Better informed decision making through the aggregation, synthesis, and analysis of data- Higher levels of civic engagement and provision of valuable public feedback to government officials regarding local issuesThis policy and the process outlined within seeks to move the City toward proactive publication of selected data containing information consistent with relevant public records law and pertinent to the City’s programmatic priorities, beginning with data related to identified key strategic goals.While advancing these public objectives, this policy upholds that the protection of privacy, confidentiality, and security will be maintained as a paramount priority.### II. DEFINITIONSa. “Data” means statistical, factual, and quantitative information that is regularly maintained or created by or on behalf of a City department.b. “Open Data” means data that is available online, in an open format, with minimal legal encumbrances on use or reuse.c. “Open format” means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform independent, machine-readable method for formatting data that permits automated processing of such data and facilitates search capabilities.d. “Dataset” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.e. “Protected information” means any dataset or portion thereof to which an agency may deny access pursuant to applicable laws, rules, and regulations.f. “Sensitive information” means any data that, if published on the Open Data Web Portal, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data.g. “Publishable data” means data that is not protected or sensitive and that has been prepared for release on the Open Data Web Portal.### III. IMPLEMENTATIONThe City will develop and implement practices that allow it to:1. Continuously advance Open Data practices that move the City closer to the eventual goal of proactive release of all publishable City data, making it freely available in open formats, with minimal restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users to use for varying purposes; [The Data available via the Open Data Web Portal will be licensed under a standard “Creative Commons” public copyright license which enables the free distribution of otherwise copyrighted data.]2. Establish and maintain an Open Data Web Portal that provides a central location for published City data;3. Publish quality, updated data with documentation about the data (metadata) to encourage maximum use;4. Automate where possible the publishing and update process to ensure the most current data is available on the portal and reduce resource time spent in publishing data;5. Minimize limitations on the disclosure of public information while appropriately safeguarding protected and sensitive information; and6. Encourage innovative uses of the City’s publishable data by agencies, the public, and other partners.The development and implementation of these practices shall be overseen by the Open Data Advisory Group, who shall be appointed by and report directly to the City Manager and Assistant City Manager.### V. GOVERNANCEImplementation of the Open Data Initiative will be overseen by the Open Data Advisory Group who will work with the City’s departments to:1. Identify the data owners who will be involved with the department’s participation in the Open Data Initiative;2. Oversee the development of a prioritized inventory of datasets held by departments that can be published to the Open Data Web Portal;3. Develop and implement a process for determining the relative level of risk and public benefit associated with potentially sensitive, non-protected information so as to make a determination about whether and how to publish it;4. Establish processes for publishing and keeping up to date datasets to the Open Data Web Portal, including processes for ensuring that datasets are reviewed for use appropriate formats, quality, timeliness, and exclusion of protected and sensitive information;5. Develop and oversee the Open Data Web Portal platform.6. Ensure that – where possible – the automation of data publishing to ensure the most current data is available.In order to increase and improve use of the City’s Open Data, the Open Data Advisory Group will actively encourage department and public participation through providing opportunities for 4 feedback and collaboration on the portal and through internal and public sessions.### VI. PRIORITIZATION AND ITERATIVE APPROACHThe Open Data Advisory Group will be charged with developing and implementing a process for prioritizing the release of datasets to the Open Data Web Portal that takes into account the City’s programmatic priorities, new and existing signals of interest from the public (such as the frequency of FOIA requests), existing opportunities for data use in the public interest, and cost;1. Datasets identified as pertinent to measuring progress of the City's Strategic Plan Goals will be given a high priority;2. Processes developed through the initial release of prioritized data will be continuously evaluated and replicated as part of an iterative process intended to expand to all City data over time, moving the City closer to the stated goal of proactive release of publishable data.### VII. OPEN DATA REPORT AND REVIEWWithin one year of the effective date of this Management Policy, and thereafter once per year, the Open Data Advisory Group shall submit to the City Manager and City Council an annual Open Data Report. The report shall include an assessment of progress towards achievement of the goals of the City's Open Data program, a list of datasets currently available on the Open Data Web Portal, and a description and publication timeline for datasets envisioned to be published on the portal in the following year.During the review and reporting period, the Open Data Advisory Group shall make recommendations for improving the City's Open Data management processes in order to ensure that the City continues to move towards the achievement of this policy's goals."

The requirements of this Open Data Policy shall apply to any City of Evanston department, office, administrative unit, commission, board, advisory committee or other division of the City of Evanston government (agency), including the records of third party agency contractors that create or acquire information, records, or data on behalf of a Evanston agency.## Section 3: Governance1. Implementation of the Open Data Program will be overseen by the City Manager or his/her designee, who will work with the City of Evanston's departments and agencies to:  A.      Identify and publish appropriate contact information for each lead open data steward who will be responsible for managing that department's or agency's participation in the Open Data Program;  B.      Oversee the creation of a comprehensive inventory of datasets held by each City of Evanston agency which is published to the central open data location and is regularly updated;  C.      Develop and implement a process for determining the relative level of risk and public benefit associated with potentially sensitive, non-protected information so as to make a determination about whether and how to publish it;  D.      Develop and implement a process for prioritizing the release of datasets which takes into account new and existing signals of interest from the public (such as the frequency of public records requests), the City of Evanston's programmatic priorities, existing opportunities for data use in the public interest, and cost;  E.      Proactively consult with members of the public, agency staff, journalists, researchers, and other stakeholders to identify the datasets which will have the greatest benefit to Evanston residents if published in a high quality manner;  F.      Establish processes for publishing datasets to the central open data location, including processes for ensuring that datasets are high quality, up-to-date, are in use-appropriate formats, and exclude protected and sensitive information;  G.

We are committed to being a technology leader and a high-performing governmental organization. As such, the Town will provide high-quality data to stakeholders to improve efficiency and decision making, while enhancing trust and confidence among our residents by providing an open, user-friendly, single point of access for data.The Town believes that access to public information promotes a higher level of civic engagement and allows citizens to provide valuable feedback to government officials regarding local issues. The thoughtful implementation of an open data program improves provision of services, increases transparency and access to public information, and enhances coordination and efficiencies among departments, partner organizations, and citizens. Through the Gilbert Open Data Initiative, the Town hopes to proactively provide information currently sought through public records requests, thereby saving the Town time and money and, in commitment to the spirit of Open Government, the Town will consider public information to be open by default and will proactively publish data and data containing contextual information, consistent with relevant public records law. Additionally, the protection of privacy, confidentiality and security will be maintained as a paramount priority while also advancing the government’s transparency and accountability through open data.## Section 1: PurposeThe purpose of this policy is to formally establish the guidelines and procedures to support the Gilbert Open Data Initiative. The Gilbert Open Data Administrative Procedure, or the “policy”, defines Gilbert’s commitment to creating an Open Data Portal to increase transparency of the organization and to provide tools for residents, businesses, and other stakeholders to use data and increase engagement with the Town. This Open Data Portal will ensure that data that is generated by the Town in service to residents is open and available for use by default while maintaining the privacy, security, and confidentiality of that data. The Town recognizes that information and data are valuable resources that belong to residents and that making these resources available can fuel innovation, engagement, and discovery.This policy applies to all officers and employees of the Town who create, manipulate or acquire information, records, or data on behalf of the Town. The requirements of this policy  t apply to any Town department, office, administrative unit, commission, board, advisory committee, or other division of the Town government (“agency”), including the records of third party agency contractors that create, maintain, or acquire information, records, or data on behalf of a Town agency, that are reasonably related to the goals and mission of the Town or as defined by the laws of the State of Arizona.## Section 2: Definitions“**Data**” means narrative, textual, geospatial, tabular, legislative, statistical, factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that is maintained or created by or on behalf of the Town.

This definition is also inclusive of any software source code made available online (“open source software”).“**Metadata**” means contextual information about a set of data that is served alongside the data and contains, at minimum, the party responsible for the data, the frequency of updates to the data, the date of last publication, any creation processes and modifications made to the source data to allow for publication, unique identifiers that distinguish the data as a whole as well as individual identifiers that distinguish entries in the data, and any other information that provides factual context or support for the data. Ideally, the metadata accompanying a dataset are sufficient to permit a data user to find, evaluate, understand, and re-use that dataset without needing to seek additional information.“**Open format**” means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machine-readable data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis and search capabilities.“**Dataset**” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.“**Protected information**” means any dataset or portion thereof to which an agency may deny access pursuant to the Town of Gilbert’s Privacy and State of Arizona public records laws or any other law or rule or regulation.“**Sensitive information**” means any data which, if published by the Town online, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data.“**Publishable data**” means data which is not protected or sensitive and which has been prepared for release to the public.## Section 3: Open Data ProgramThe Town commits to develop and implement practices that will allow it to:- Proactively release publishable Town data, making it freely available in appropriately varied and useful open formats, using an open license with no restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users to use for varying purposes;- Publish high quality, updated data with documentation (metadata) and permanence to encourage maximum use;- Provide or support access to free, historical archives of all released Town data;- Measure the effectiveness of datasets made available through the Open Data Program by connecting open data efforts to the Town’s programmatic priorities;- Minimize limitations on the disclosure of public information while appropriately safeguarding protected and sensitive information;- Support innovative uses of the Town’s publishable data by agencies, the public, and other partners.The development and implementation of these practices shall be overseen by the Open Data Administrator, reporting to the Town Manager. Appropriate funding shall be made available to achieve the goals of this program.## Section 4: Open Data Leadership TeamIn order to support this initiative, the Town will develop an Open Data Leadership Team that consists of representatives from each department within the organization, an Open Data Administrator, and the Town Manager. Implementation of the Open Data Program will be overseen by the Open Data Administrator and work with the Leadership Team and any associated departments and agencies to:- Maintain an Open Data Guidebook for use by all Town staff responsible for management, review, or publication of data;- Identify and publish appropriate contact information for an open data coordinator who will be responsible for managing that department’s participation in the Open Data Program;- Oversee the creation and maintenance of a comprehensive inventory of datasets held by each Town department in conjunction with Town IT staff which is published to the central open data location and is regularly updated;- Review and determine the relative level of risk and public benefit associated with potentially sensitive, non-protected information based on the annual security audit done by Town IT staff so as to make a determination about whether and how to publish it;- Develop and implement a process for prioritizing the release of datasets which takes into account new and existing signals of interest from the public (such as the frequency of public records requests), the Town's programmatic priorities, existing opportunities for data use in the public interest, and cost;- Proactively consult with members of the public, agency staff, journalists, researchers, and other stakeholders to identify the datasets which will have the greatest benefit to Town residents if published in a high quality manner;- Establish processes for publishing datasets to the central open data location, including processes for ensuring that datasets are high quality, up-to-date, are in use-appropriate formats, and exclude protected and sensitive information;- Ensure that appropriate metadata is provided for each dataset in order to facilitate its use;- Develop and oversee a routinely updated, public timeline for new dataset publication;- Make recommendations for historical document inclusion and define a schedule for approved historical document publication;- Ensure that published datasets are available for bulk download and/or available via public application programming interfaces (APIs) without legal encumbrance.To increase and improve use of the Town’s open data, the Data Administrator will actively encourage agency and public participation by providing regular opportunities for feedback and collaboration.## Section 4: Open Data PortalThe Town will create and maintain a publicly available location on the Town's website or in another suitable online location where the Town’s published data will be available for download.Published datasets shall be placed into the public domain. Dedicating datasets to the public domain means that there are no restrictions or requirements placed on use of these datasets.Each published dataset should be associated with contact information for the appropriate manager of that dataset as well as with a file layout or data dictionary that provides information about field labels and values. Town departments will specify a recommended data citation form available for viewing on the central online location for published Town data to encourage responsible reuse of Town data.## Section 5: Open Data Report and ReviewWithin one year of the effective date of this policy, the Open Data Administrator shall publish an annual Open Data Report on the Town website and review the report with the Town Council during, at minimum, one Council retreat per year. The report shall include:- an assessment of progress towards achievement of the goals of the Town’s Open Data Program;- an assessment of how the Town’s open data work has furthered or will further the Town’s strategic goals and priorities;- a summary of any public benefit associated with the publication or release of the data- a description and publication timeline for datasets envisioned to be published by the Town in the following year;- a list and descriptions of datasets that have been published by the Town in the prior year.Additionally, the Open Data Administrator should also oversee a review process for improving the Town’s open data management based on reviews from the Leadership Team, as well as suggestions from public and internal staff, to ensure the Town continues to move towards the achievement of the program’s goals. Public feedback for this review process will be collected during Open Data Community Meetings held by the Open Data Administrator."

Data becomes information when analyzed and possibly combined with other data in order to extract meaning and provide context.Data Governance Standards – an overarching set of best practices, procedures, and processes that define the vision and daily operation of an open data program, roles and responsibilities of leadership and data coordinators within the program, a method for identifying and prioritizing datasets for publishing and continuous updating, and a means for evaluating success of the open data program for improvement.Dataset – means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.Metadata – is data that provides information about other data. Two types of metadata exist: structural metadata and descriptive metadata. Structural metadata is data about the containers of data. Descriptive metadata uses individual instances of application data or the data content.Open Data – Public records as defined by NCGS-132 and provided in a convenient, modifiable form such that there are no unnecessary technological obstacles to the use of the data. For the purposes of this policy, open data is made machine readable via Application Programming Interfaces (API), available in bulk, and provided in an open format such as a .CSV file. Greensboro’s open data is generated and maintained by the City, openly shared, and available to the public in accordance with public records laws.Open Data Leadership Team – as defined by the data governance standards document is an empowered body of people representing the governance committee and shall consist of municipality executive leadership and inclusive of inputs from the public. This body will ensure adherence to the data governance standards established and will serve to modify those standards as necessary to ensure best practices can be achieved in an ever-changing technological or consumer environment.Open Format – means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform independent, machine-readable method for formatting data that permits automated processing of such data and facilitates search capabilities.Portal – a means, usually a technology application, for transmitting open data for use, reuse, and redistribution.Publishable Data – data which is not protected or sensitive and which can be prepared for release to the public.## Defining the Vision of the Greensboro’s Open Data Program and InitiativesOpen data created and maintained by the City of Greensboro is a public good and should be released to and leveraged in service of Greensboro’s residents, businesses, and institutions. Greensboro’s Open Data Program is a set of systems, technologies, and policies for maximizing the value of Greensboro’s data.The open data program increases the value of city data by:- Releasing data in service of transparency and community engagement, so that residents understand what their city is doing.- Enabling city staff and the public to use the data in analyses and software applications that help Greensboro deliver services more efficiently.- Providing businesses and other organizations with relevant data at no cost, so that Greensboro continues to maintain a thriving local economy.- Removing silos between city departments, thereby fostering data-sharing and enabling efficiency improvements for city service delivery.Greensboro’s Open Data Program is intended to increase community engagement, economic well-being, internal data sharing, data-driven decision-making, and government transparency. These outcomes are the result of efforts by the open data program and its stakeholders to supply city data and market it both internally and externally. Note that these outcomes are also affected by numerous intervening factors such as other city activities, city finances, and the state of the economy. More immediate outcomes of the open data program include an awareness of open data among both city staff and the public, as well as consistent growth of the supply of data.### The City of Greensboro will develop and implement best practices that allow it to:(1) Release all potential open City data, making it freely available in open formats without any licensing fees, with no restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users to use for varying purposes;(2) Publish high quality, updated data with documentation (metadata) and permanence to encourage maximal use;(3) Establish and maintain an open data web portal that provides a central location for published City data;(4) Encourage innovative uses of the City’s publishable data by departments, the public, and other partners.The development and implementation of these best practices shall be overseen by the Open Data Leadership Team.

Findings and Purpose. </p> <p/> <p><span class=g-goals-and-values>The City Council finds that in recent years, the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents, or other mechanisms of Control, has become prevalent. This concept, which is generally referred to as open data, applies to data that is already deemed public and made available electronically, such as on a website; it could include department, agency, and legislative data. </span><span class=def-open><span class=g-goals-and-values>Open data is not data that is subject to privacy, security, confidentiality or any protection of the law.</span></span></p> <p/> <p><span class=def-public><span class=g-goals-and-values>Information held by the City and County of Honolulu that has been deemed public information by the State Office of Information Practices should be made available in open, standards-based <span class=g-public-apis>machine-readable formats.</span> This may be accomplished by establishing an Application Programming Interface or by hosting the data on the City’s open data portal at https://data.honolulu.</span>qov.</p> <p/> <p>The Council further finds that on June 26, 2012, the Governor issued an Executive Directive to all state department heads announcing the Open Data Initiative. On August 10, 2012, then-candidate and current Mayor Kirk Caldwell, signed an Open Data Pledge. On October 4, 2012, State Chief data officer Sanjeev Bhagowalia unveiled the State</span>’<span class=g-build-on-precedent><span class=g-goals-and-values>s Twelve Year IT Transformation Plan, </span>which included as one of its top priorities the establishment of a State open data portal at https://data.hawaii.gov. The City followed suit and created https://data.honolulu.qov. These actions enabled public facing websites to facilitate the sharing of master data sets. On July 3, 2013, the Governor signed into law Act 263, which relates to open data. This new law requires state executive branch departments to make electronic data sets available to the public, absolves the State from liability for certain deficiencies or incomplete data, and requires the Chief data officer to <span class=g-data-quality>develop policies and procedures to implement the o</span>pen data initiative.</p> <p/> <p><span class=g-partnerships>Finally, the Council finds that an open data policy has been shown to drive increased government efficiency and civic engagement, leading to social and economic benefits as a result of innovative citizen interaction with government. Social and economic benefits include, but are not limited to, empowering citizens through the democratization of information and fostering citizen participation in city government projects, supporting early stage entrepreneurship, encouraging positive environments that contribute to workforce development and job creation, and fostering a positive business environment and public-private partnerships.</span></span></p> <p/> <p>The purpose of this ordinance is to increase public awareness of and access to data and information created by and available from City departments, agencies, and offices, enhance government transparency and accountability, encourage public engagement, and stimulate innovation with the development of new analyses or applications based on the unique data provided by the City.</p> <p/> <p>SECTION 2.

While the Portal platform and database system(s) may change over time, it will always be publicly accessible at: http://data.jerseycitynj.gov.Below is an overview of the policies and procedures governing the dissemination and publication of data through the Jersey City Open Data Portal.If anyone should have any questions, please contact the Jersey City Office of Innovation at (201) 547-6587 or email the Director, Brian Platt, at BPlatt@jcnj.org.Sincerely,The Jersey City Office of InnovationLast Revision: July 1 2017## Jersey City Open Data Policy### Data Collection ProcessAll Jersey City government agencies, departments, divisions, offices, and other related entities shall, make a good faith effort to build robust data recording and management systems and processes. These systems may vary from manual collection processes to automated feeds transmitting data directly from the point of capture to the Data Portal.The Office of Innovation is committed to working with all parties to ensure any data collection processes do not substantially inhibit workflow or other daily operations.### Data Included, Exemptions and RestrictionsAll data (see below definitions) capturing relevant information about government operations and activities shall be included, with the following exceptions:1. The City shall be exempt from publishing any data that would be exempt from disclosure based on any exemption set forth in the New Jersey Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq. or any other exemptions required by law.2. The Data Portal shall never include:    a. Personally identifiable information of government employees or any other people    b. Information that reflects the internal deliberative process of a department or departments, including but not limited to negotiating positions, future procurements, or pending or reasonably anticipated legal or administrative proceedings    c. Proprietary applications, computer code, software, operating systems or similar materials    d. Attorney-client work product or internal discussions in anticipation of litigation.Data shall never be deleted from the Data Portal unless it is incorrect or incomplete.A list of all published data sets shall be readily available at all times on the Data Portal.### Data Structure, Format, and QualityData shall be produced and published in non-proprietary, searchable, sortable, platformindependent, machine readable format(s) consistent with applicable open data standards and practices.Data shall be able to be viewed directly on the portal and available for export through the Portal in .pdf, .xml, .csv and/or tabular formats.Application Programming Interface (API) documentation (see below definitions) for automated downloads shall be made available on the Data Portal.All available metadata and metadata documentation (see below definitions) shall be made public on the Data Portal.Data shall be searchable through the Data Portal either by keyword search, browsing by type of operation, or by scrolling through lists or carousels of data sets and analyses.### Maintenance and ManagementThe City responsible shall develop and manage appropriate Exchange, Transfer, and Loading (ETL) processes that allow for any edits to the data to make it suitable to publication on the Data Portal. The City shall also ensure published data remains accurate and aligns with the policy set forth here.### Publishing and UpdatesData shall be refreshed and updated at reasonable intervals when new data becomes available.Data sets may be updated weekly, daily, or in real time as is reasonable given the type of data, technology capacity, and amount of data produced. The preferred maximum update interval is one month. Regardless of data update intervals, each data set shall be reviewed for accuracy at least once annually by the Office of Innovation.### Public Use of DataThe City shall not place any restrictions on third-party reuse of data. The City shall not provide to third parties any copies, records or logs of the identities or IP addresses of individuals accessing the data or the Portal, with the exception of a valid law enforcement purpose.### Definitions (based on the White House Project Open Data):APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API): Software and/or other code/programming elements and specifications that describe how programs and software communicate and share data and other relevant information.CSV: A comma separated values (CSV) file is a computer data file used for implementing the tried and true organizational tool, the Comma Separated List. The CSV file is used for the digital storage of data structured in a table of lists form. Each line in the CSV file corresponds to a row in the table. Within a line, fields are separated by commas, and each field belongs to one table column. CSV files are often used for moving tabular data between two different computer programs (like moving between a database program and a spreadsheet program).DATA: A value or set of values representing a specific concept or concepts. Data become “information” when analyzed and possibly combined with other data in order to extract meaning, and to provide context. The meaning of data can vary depending on its context. Data includes all data. It includes, but is not limited to, 1) geospatial data 2) unstructured data, 3) structured data, etc.DATASET: named collection of related, digitally-stored data with the collection containing individual Data units organized or formatted in a specific and prescribed way, often in tabular form, and accessed by a specific access method that is based on the Dataset organization, but not including any Data that is protected from disclosure under applicable Federal or State law.DEPARTMENT: any subdivision within the municipal government, and any bureau or office under it, which performs a function of municipal government.JSON: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.MACHINE-READABLE FILE: Refers to information or data that is in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.METADATA: To facilitate common understanding, a number of characteristics, or attributes, of data are defined. These characteristics of data are known as “metadata”, that is, “data that describes data.” For any particular datum, the metadata may describe how the datum is represented, ranges of acceptable values, its relationship to other data, and how it should be labeled. Metadata also may provide other relevant information, such as the responsible steward, associated laws and regulations, and access management policy. Each of the types of data described above has a corresponding set of metadata. Two of the many metadata standards are the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and Department of Defense Discovery Metadata Standard (DDMS). The metadata for structured data objects describes the structure, data elements, interrelationships, and other characteristics of information, including its creation, disposition, access and handling controls, formats, content, and context, as well as related audit trails. Metadata includes data element names (such as Organization Name, Address, etc.), their definition, and their format (numeric, date, text, etc.). In contrast, data is the actual data values such as the “US Patent and Trade Office” or the “Social Security Administration” for the metadata called “Organization Name”. Metadata may include metrics about an organization’s data including its data quality (accuracy, completeness, etc.).OPEN DATA PORTAL/DATA PORTAL: the electronic software platform where Datasets are hosted and made available to the public.OPEN DATA STANDARD: the generally accepted technical standards developed to provide consistency of data presentation in Open Data Portals.XML: Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a flexible language for creating common information formats and sharing both the format and content of data over the Internet and elsewhere. XML is a formatting language recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).To see a full list of definitions, please visit this site: https://project-open-data.cio.gov/glossary/ "

(“TPRA”), or other law, and consistent with Mayoral Executive Orders 35 and 38.</span></span>## III. DefinitionsIn the interpretation and application of this policy, the terms defined in this section shall have the following meanings:1. “Classify” or “Classifications” means the classifications applied to Metropolitan Government public information, internal information, confidential information and restricted information, as those classifications are defined in the “Information Classification Policy,” which is policy No. 7.2.1. of the Information Security Policies of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, effective November 1, 2011, recommended by the Information Security Steering Committee and adopted by the Director of ITS as provided for in Executive Order 38, and all subsequent amendments thereto.2. <span class=def-data>“Data” or “Structured Data” means final versions of statistical or factual information that (i) have a high degree of standardized organization, such as information found in a tabular format, which allows for ready use by import into non-originating systems for purposes of searching, reporting or manipulation; and (ii) are regularly created or maintained in digital format by or on behalf of a Department and are controlled by such Department; and (iii) record a measurement, transaction or determination related to the mission of such Department. The terms “Data” and “Structured Data” shall not include information in a narrative form, information provided to a Department by other governmental entities; nor image files, such as designs, drawings, photos or scanned copies of original documents; provided, however, that the term “Data” shall include statistical or factual information about image files and geographic information system (GIS) data. The terms “Data” and “Structured Data” shall not include any records included in the definition of Protected Information, below.</span>3. “Data Catalog” means a catalog created by a Departmental Data Coordinator containing an inventory of all available Datasets of the Department and their relevant Metadata, excluding Protected Information.4. “Dataset” means any organized collection of data. The most basic form of a Dataset is data elements presented in a tabular form, with each data element represented by a column. Each row corresponds to a given value of that column’s data elements. Datasets may also present information in non-tabular formats such as a geospatial data file.5. “Department” or “Departmental” means any Metropolitan Government department, agency, office, administrative unit, commission, board, or other division of Metropolitan Government subject to the executive authority of the Mayor.6. “Departmental Data Coordinator” means the person within a Metropolitan Government Department who is designated by the Department Head to have the responsibility to catalog, classify (per the Information Classification Policy) and facilitate the potential submission for publication of Departmental Data.7. “Metadata” means any information that is used to provide descriptive detail about a Dataset.8. <span class=def-open>“Open Data” means Structured Data that is collected by a Department covered by this Executive Order where the Department is permitted, required or able to make the Data available to the public, consistent with any and all applicable laws, rules, regulations,  ordinances, resolutions, policies or other restrictions, requirements or rights associated with the Data, including but not limited to contractual or other legal orders, restrictions or requirements. Data shall not be Open Data if it meets the definition of Protected Information.</span>9. “Open Data Portal” means the Internet site established and maintained by or on behalf of Metropolitan Government, located at http://data.nashville.gov or its successor website.10. “Open Format” means any widely accepted, non-proprietary, platform-independent, machine-readable method for formatting Data, which permits automated processing of such Data.11. <span class=g-sensitive-information>“Protected Information” means, but is not limited to (i) all confidential or restricted information, as defined in the Information Classification Policy, or any record or portion thereof, disclosure of which could be denied under the TPRA or other law; ii) any record that contains a significant amount of confidential information as to which access may be denied pursuant to the TPRA or any other law, if the removal of such confidential information from those records, that would otherwise meet the definition of Data or a Dataset, would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the Metropolitan Government; (iii) any record that reflects the internal deliberative or administrative process(es) of any Department, including, but not limited to, records on negotiating positions, future procurements or pending or reasonably anticipated legal or administrative proceedings; (iv) any record subject to privacy laws, or to copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret protection, or that are otherwise protected by law or contract; (v) proprietary applications, computer code, software, operating systems or similar materials; (vi) employment records, internal employee-related directories or lists, facilities records , information technology, internal service-desk records or other records related to the internal administration of a Department; or (vii) any information which, if disclosed on the Metropolitan Government’s Open Data Portal, would raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns, or jeopardize or have the potential to jeopardize, public health, safety or welfare.</span>12. “Secondary Use” means any use of Data to produce another set of information, functionality, records, or modification of the Data beyond the original intent of the use of the Data by the owning Department.13. “Unstructured Data” means information that is effectively the opposite of what is defined above as Structured Data; information that is not consistently stored by predefined format, location or content, thus making it inconvenient for ready use by import into non-originating systems for purposes of searching, reporting or manipulation. Examples include email messages, videos, photos, presentations, web pages and other types of documents. Note that each of these examples have internal organization in place; however their form does not facilitate ready import and use by other systems.## IV.

In order to be as transparent and accountable as possible to the citizens of Norfolk, the City has adopted this Open Data Policy which is intended to ensure a high quality Open Data offering for the public.2. The Open Data Program seeks to provide direct access to City datasets in consumable formats. Providing this information gives staff and the public an opportunity to review and analyze raw data and to use it for a variety of purposes.3. This Policy is to establish a procedure for systematically identifying, inventorying, and publishing datasets that can:    a. Be used to increase accountability and responsiveness; Improve public knowledge of the City's activities and operations;    b. Further the mission of the City;    c. Allow for economic opportunity;    d. Respond to a need or demand identified by the public; and    e. Foster civic engagement.### Section 2: Definitions1. “Data” means statistical, factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that is maintained or created by or on behalf of a City agency. This definition is inclusive of software source code developed or maintained by or on behalf of the City.2. “Dataset” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.3. “Open data” means data that is available online, in an open format, with no legal encumbrances on use or reuse, and is available for all to access and download in full without fees or requirement of registration. “Legal encumbrance” includes federal copyright protections and other, non-statutory legal limitations on how or under what conditions a dataset may be used. This definition is also inclusive of any software source code made available online (“open source software”).3. “Open format” means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machinereadable data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis and search capabilities.4. “Protected information” means any dataset or portion thereof to which an agency may deny access pursuant to federal, state or local government law or regulation.5. “Publishable data” means data which is not protected or sensitive and which has been prepared for release to the public.6. “Sensitive information” means any data which, if published by the City online, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data.### Section 3: Open Data Program1. The City commits to develop and implement practices that will allow it to:    a. Proactively release publishable City data, making it freely available in appropriately varied and useful open formats, using an open license with no restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users to use for varying purposes;    b. Continuously publish high quality, updated data, with documentation (metadata) that includes the creation process and permanence to encourage maximum use;    c. Provide or support access to free, historical archives of all released City data;    d. Measure the effectiveness of datasets made available through the Open Data Program by connecting open data efforts to the City’s programmatic priorities;    e. Minimize limitations on the disclosure of public information while appropriately safeguarding protected and sensitive information; and    f. Support innovative uses of the City’s publishable data by agencies, the public, and other partners.    g. Ensure all data sets contain unique identifiers so that users can verify historical consistency of data.    h. Encourage electronic methods of data collection to avoid inefficiencies of paperbased filing systems and make real-time disclosures possible.2. The development and implementation of these practices shall be overseen by the Chief Information Officer, reporting to the City Manager.3. The requirements of this Policy shall apply to all City Departments, including the records of third party contractors that create or acquire information, records, or data on behalf of a City Department.4. Appropriate funding shall be made available to achieve the goals of this program.### Section 4: Governance1. Implementation of the Open Data Program will be overseen by the Chief Information Officer, who will work with the City Departments to:    a. For each City Department, identify and publish appropriate contact information for a lead open data coordinator who will be responsible for managing that Department’s participation in the Open Data Program;    b. Recommend members for appointment to the City’s Open Data Advisory Committee (to include members of the public, members of City Council and members of the business community), with the mission of providing input regarding datasets to release, priorities, and implementation timelines.    c. Oversee the creation of a comprehensive inventory of datasets held by each City Department which is published to the central open data location and is regularly updated;    d. Develop and implement a process for determining the relative level of risk and public benefit associated with potentially sensitive, non-protected information so as to make a determination about whether and how to publish it;    e. Develop and implement a process for prioritizing the release of datasets which takes into account new and existing signals of interest from the public (such as the frequency of public records requests), the City's programmatic priorities, existing opportunities for data use in the public interest, and cost;    f. Proactively consult with members of the public, City staff, colleges and universities, researchers, and other stakeholders to identify the datasets which will have the greatest benefit to City residents if published in a high quality manner;    g. Establish processes for publishing datasets to the central open data location, including processes for ensuring that datasets are high quality, up-to-date, are in use-appropriate formats, and exclude protected and sensitive information;    h. Ensure that appropriate metadata is provided for each dataset in order to facilitate its use;    i. Develop and oversee a routinely updated, public timeline for new dataset publication; and    j. Make recommendations for historical document inclusion and define a schedule for approved historical document publication k. Ensure that published datasets are available for bulk download and/or available via public application programming interfaces (“APIs”) without legal encumbrance.2. In order to increase and improve use of the City’s open data, the Chief Information Officer will actively encourage Department and public participation through providing regular opportunities for feedback and collaboration.### Section 5: Central Online Location for Published Data1. The City will create and maintain a publicly available location on the City's website or in another suitable online location where the City’s published data will be available for download.2. Published datasets shall be placed into the public domain. Dedicating datasets to the public domain means that there are no restrictions or requirements placed on use of these datasets.3. Each published dataset should be associated with contact information for the appropriate manager of that dataset as well as with a file layout or data dictionary that provides information about field labels and values.4. City Departments will specify a recommended data citation form available for viewing on the central online location for published City data to encourage responsible reuse of City data.### Section 6: Open Data Report and Review1. Within one year of the effective date of this Policy, and thereafter no later than July 1 st of each year, the Chief Information Officer shall publish an annual Open Data Report.

The Council finds:1. The City of Portland is committed to the publication, open access, and widespread sharing of data collected and generated by the City, and by private sector companies, non-profit organizations, academia, and other parties working on behalf of the City. An Open Data Policy and Program will increase transparency, foster a culture of using data to inform and evaluate City decisions, reduce staff time devoted to responding to requests for City data, encourage innovative approaches to meeting City goals, and achieve more equitable program and service outcomes.2. In 2009, Portland became the first city in the United States to adopt an Open Data Resolution (Resolution No. 36735) to encourage the expansion of the technological community by promoting open data and partnerships between City government and the public, private and nonprofit sectors, academia, and labor. The directives in the Resolution applied to the Bureau of Technology Services and the City's Purchasing Agent. The directives included publishing and maintaining public datasets, developing a strategy to adopt prevailing open data standards, organizing regional contests to encourage the development of software applications, collecting, organizing, and sharing public data, and working with regional partners to promote Portland as a host city for open source conferences. Since its adoption, these parties have taken initial steps to establish an Open Data Program for the City, including the creation of the CivicApps Open Data platform and the PortlandMaps Open Data portal.3. The Portland Police Bureau launched an Open Data portal in 2017 as part of the Police Data Initiative (POI). The POI, in partnership with leading law enforcement agencies from around the country, seeks to establish a community of practice around police open data. As a participating agency, the PPB is committed to making data accessible to community members. The POI embraces open data as an important opportunity for transparency, community engagement, and innovation. The Police Bureau's participation in POI, including experience designing an open data portal, will inform the citywide Open Data Program and give the City access to a network of other jurisdictions for sharing lessons learned and best practices.4. All City bureaus collect and share data about their operations using standardized, digital formats. However, the City has no comprehensive, centralized list of existing datasets, and no process for prioritizing or reviewing of data for release to the public.5. No City policy requires City bureaus to collect, store, maintain, update, and release data to other agencies and the public on a regular basis. Multiple, redundant datasets exist across the City, leading to issues with data consistency, data quality, version control, interoperability and efficiency of access to information. Moving to an open, standardized, automated, and centralized system for managing City data will help address these issues, and also promote shared, standardized digital systems for creating and collecting data.6. Making data available via an online Open Data Portal will benefit City staff by breaking down data silos, streamlining the sharing of data across bureaus, and encouraging collaboration among City staff. A robust flow of data within the City creates a culture of information sharing that is foundational to Portland's Smart Cities efforts, which focus on using technology and data to inform decision-making and provide better, more equitable, and more accessible infrastructure and services.7. The number of public records requests to the City of Portland has increased substantially in recent years. A significant amount of staff time is devoted to addressing these requests. Self-service portals for accessing City information both improve the public's experience with requesting data and reduce staff time spent on fulfilling records requests. This will be increasingly valuable as the amount of data the City creates and collects grows. The City currently has no system for connecting public records requests to our open data portals, and no process for prioritizing data that is repeatedly requested for release to the public through our public records request system.8. Portland is home to an active and engaged technology community. Proactive collection and sharing of data by all City bureaus ensures that Portland is receiving the greatest benefit from this technology community. Proactive data sharing unlocks the social and commercial value of our assets. The private and nonprofit sectors, academia, labor community and general public can all utilize open data to help solve Portland's most pressing issues, to boost economic development, and to build ladders of opportunity for our community through innovative uses of data and technology.9. Building a culture of information sharing through open data will facilitate the development of open standards around how data is structured and delivered, an area where the Portland region has demonstrated leadership and expertise. For example, in 2005 TriMet partnered with Google to create the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), a standard for the structure of real-time transit schedule information. The benefits of this collaboration are realized by transit agencies around the world who have adopted the standard to make ridership easier for the millions of individuals who utilize public transit.10. Data about City infrastructure and use of that infrastructure is increasingly being collected by private sector companies, often passively in the public domain. Establishing processes by which private companies share this data helps the City better manage and maintain our infrastructure, informs our policy and decision-making, and encourages public participation in decisions regarding the design, maintenance and utilization of City systems and assets.11. A primary goal of the Portland Plan implementation is to coordinate processes for data collection and data analyses, in order to allow bureaus, agencies, businesses, community organizations and Portlanders to base decisions on accurate and shared information. An Open Data Program will help achieve this goal by making data more readily available to City staff and the public, by improving the quality of data, and by building a foundation for data-driven decision making.12. The Portland 2035 Comprehensive Plan Chapter 2: Community Involvement, Policy 2.11 states that the City will encourage publication, accessibility, and widespread sharing of data collected and generated by the City. Testimony to City Council during the Comprehensive Plan's adoption was strongly in favor of achieving these goals through an Open Data Program.13. The City's Citywide Racial Equity Goals & Strategies cites ...improved access to data to measure the success of specific programmatic and policy changes and to develop baselines, set goals, and measure progress as a key strategy. An Open Data Program would help achieve these racial equity goals by making data readily available and accessible, developing a more comprehensive inventory of City data, and giving the public increased transparency into the effectiveness of City programs and policies.14. Through the City's participation in the Bloomberg Philanthropies What Works Cities initiative, per City Council Resolution No. 37236, City staff have received technical assistance to advance a comprehensive Open Data strategy, and access to a peer network working on similar Open Data issues.15. Through this Ordinance, the City seeks to expand upon the work completed as a part of the 2009 Open Data Resolution (Resolution No. 36735), establishing mechanisms for engaging all City bureaus in the proactive collection and distribution of City data.NOW, THEREFORE, the Council directs:- a. The City of Portland establishes an Open Data Policy to be committed to the publication, accessibility, and equitable and widespread sharing of data collected and generated by all City bureaus and by private sector companies, non-profit organizations, academic universities and other parties working on behalf of the City. The City will strive to make data open by default.- b. To implement the Open Data Policy, the City shall create an Open Data Program which shall address the program elements and processes shown in Exhibit A.- c. The Mayor's Office shall establish and appoint members to a Data Governance Team who will be responsible for providing guidance to departments and City Council on the overall direction of the City's Open Data Program, including recommending updates to the Open Data Policy and publishing an annual report on progress toward achieving strategic goals for the Open Data Program.Section 2. The Council declares that an emergency exists because implementation should occur as soon as possible for the community benefit; therefore, this ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage by Council.Passed by the Council: MAY 03 2017Mayor Ted WheelerPrepared by: Kevin MartinDate Prepared: April 17, 2017"

General. <span class=g-goals-and-values>Government works best when it engages its constituents effectively and makes information readily available in an easily consumed format. The purpose of the Open Government Portal is threefold. <span class=g-open-formats><span class=g-open-access>First, the Portal should maximize information availability by publishing data in an understandable, logical format for anyone to access</span></span>. Second, the Portal should publish relevant and timely information so that constituents are not overwhelmed with data. This has the potential to reduce the number of </span><span class=g-build-on-precedent><span class=g-goals-and-values>Government Records Access and Management Act</span> (GRAMA) requests received by the City. Third, the Portal should be a central clearinghouse for data that enables the citizen developer to create applications independently. Citizen developers are constituents who have the technical acumen to develop an app that pulls pieces of information from these data sources and presents that data in a format that meets a need in the community. This fosters creativity, alleviates a burden on IT departments, and provides tools that the City may not have considered.</span></p><p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance regarding the processes that the City will employ to determine what information is of importance to the public, how it will be presented, and how often it will be updated.</p><p>2.   Oversight Committee. <span class=g-oversight-authority>The City will empanel an oversight committee to assist in this process. <span class=g-data-quality>The overarching function of the committee is to vet information proposed to be published to ensure the data provides an accurate statement of the facts, does not violate privacy, and does not compromise personal or public safety concerns</span>. Additionally, the committee will look at the specific data sets to reduce or eliminate the City’s exposure to unacceptable risk or liability.  The Committee will consist of a representative from:</span></p><p>a.   The Mayor’s Office</p><p>b.   <span class=g-oversight-authority>The City Attorney’s Office</span></p><p>c.   <span class=g-oversight-authority>The Human Resources Department</span></p><p>d.   IMS</p><p>e.   <span class=g-oversight-authority>City Recorder (or designee)</span></p><p>f.	<span class=g-oversight-authority>Departmental representatives. Departmental representatives will be ad hoc members of the committee who serve when data owned by their department is being reviewed.</span></p><p><span class=g-oversight-authority>The committee will also include a representative from the City Council’s Office, at the discretion of the City Council.  IMS will provide support staff to the committee.</span></p><p>3.   Responsibilities. The mission of the committee is to provide oversight regarding the <span class=g-prioritization>information that will be published on the Open Data Portal</span>. To that end, several aspects need may be considered.</p><p>a.   Technical feasibility. Can the data reasonably be modeled in a way that makes it useful and does not present erroneous or distorted interpretations of the data?</p><p>i. IMS will designate the appropriate personnel to cover the technical aspect of extracting and modeling the data.</p><p>ii.        	Department representatives will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the data and that it is presented in a useful way.</p><p>b.   Privacy.  Information in City data sets may contain sensitive information that is protected by federal, state, or local law.</p><p>i. The Attorney’s Office will provide legal input regarding federal, state, or local laws relating to privacy.</p><p>ii.        	The HR Department will provide input to ensure that data sets proposed to be published do not contain elements that may compromise the personal information of employees or constituents.</p><p>c.   Personal Safety. Information contained in City data sets could be used to in such a way that might compromise the personal safety of employees, victims of crime, witnesses to crimes, or other scenarios.</p><p>i. The Attorney’s Office will provide legal input regarding federal, state, or local laws relating to personal safety.</p><p>ii.        	The representative of the department owning the proposed data set will be responsible to that ensure the information contained in the data set does not release information that could be used to compromise the personal safety of any individuals, groups, or organizations.</p><p>d.   Public Safety. Information contained in City data sets could be used to in such a way to compromise the safety of the residents, businesses, and visitors to the City or to disrupt City services.</p><p>i. The Attorney’s Office will provide legal input regarding federal, state, or local laws relating to public safety.</p><p>ii.        	The representative of the department owning the proposed data set will be responsible to ensure that the information contained in the data set does release information that could be used to compromise public safety or to disrupt City services.</p><p>e.

Termsthat are defined in the Open Data Policy shall have the same meaning in this Implementation Plan.## 1.0 Starting the clockThe Open Data Policy (Policy) will become effective on the date upon which the Resolution authorizingthe Policy takes effect (Effective Date). The Policy requires activities to occur within a certain number ofdays of its effective date. The Economic Development and Intergovernmental Relations Committeeunanimously forwarded the Policy to the full City Council (Council) on July 2, 2014. Council is expectedto consider the Policy in December. For purposes of developing this implementation plan, the Policy’sEffective Date is assumed to be no later than January 1, 2015.## 2.0 Selecting the Chief Data OfficerMany cities with open data policies have found filling the position of CDO to be an important step inlegitimizing the open data effort. There is no “one size fits all” approach to filling the position of CDO.Examples of effective CDOs can come from a more internally/service-focused background or,alternatively, a more externally/community-focused approach. If it is the right person, either model canwork. However, in either case, it is essential that the individual has a direct connection to the top – anexecutive champion who is committed and has the organizational strength to push the open datainitiative. The individual selected should have a familiarity and comfort level with the technologyinvolved in open data programs, but the position is not just a technical position. It is important that theindividual be committed to the initiative and able to articulate a compelling vision of the benefits of theprogram.Starting in Fiscal Year 2015, the Chief Data Officer (CDO) is a program manager position in thePerformance and Analytics Department. To support hiring the CDO as quickly as possible, the positiondescription and applicable paperwork were completed in June 2014. Out of 46 applicants, 15candidates were selected for interview. An initial offer was made in September, and the Chief DataOfficer’s start date is November 24, 2014.## 3.0 Developing guidelines for preparing an inventory of dataWithin his or her first four months of duty, the CDO will prepare written guidelines that describe how toprepare an inventory of Data Sets (Inventory Guidelines). The CDO will identify Open Datarepresentatives from all City departments and consult with them while preparing the InventoryGuidelines. The CDO will release the guidelines by March 31, 2015.## 4.0 Developing initial inventory of dataUpon issuance of the guidelines on preparing data inventories, each City department will assemble aninitial inventory of data owned or managed by the department. The CDO will compile all of the initialinventory inputs into a report on Public Data Sets (as defined in the Policy) to be published no later thanthe earlier of 120 days after the issuance of the guidelines, or July 1, 2015.## 5.0 Developing and issuing Technical GuidelinesAfter issuing the Inventory Guidelines and while the departments are working on their initial inventories,the CDO will develop and issue Technical Guidelines for the publishing of Public Data Sets through a webportal, for the purpose of making Public Data Sets available to the greatest number of users and for thegreatest number of applications and shall, whenever practicable, use Voluntary Compliance Standardsfor web publishing and e-government. The CDO will issue the Technical Guidelines no later than July 1,2015.## 6.0 Developing written Status ReportWithin 180 days of the Effective Date (or by July 1, 2015), the CDO shall submit a written status reportto the Mayor and the Council and shall make such report available to the public on the City web site.The CDO shall provide an updated status report to the appropriate City Council committee within 12months of the Effective Date and annually thereafter.## 7.0 Preparing a Data Portal and Making Public Data Sets availableThe CDO will work with the Purchasing & Contracting Department to determine the procurementapproach for obtaining the services of a data portal provider. This may involve developing aStatement of Work to be included in a Request for Proposals, or it may involve a more streamlinedprocurement approach.Within 18 months of the Policy Effective Date, or by July 1, 2016, the City will begin to publish highvalue Public Data Sets to its portal.## 8.0 Developing Compliance PlanWithin 18 months of the Effective Date (or by July 1, 2016), the CDO shall submit a Compliance Plan tothe Mayor and the Council and shall make such plan available to the public on the City web site. Theplan shall include an inventory and a summary description of Public Data Sets under the control ofeach City department and also include a timeline for publication to the web portal of high valueexisting Public Data Sets, as determined by the CDO with input from the public, with allhigh value Public Data Sets being published within five years of the Effective Date of this Policy. If aPublic Data Set cannot be made available on the web portal within the specified time, the plan shallstate the reasons why such high value Public Data Set cannot be made available, and, to the extentpracticable, the date by which the City department that owns the data believes that it will beavailable on the web portal.Annually following the first publication of the Compliance Plan, the CDO shall post on the web portalan update of the Compliance P lan, until all Public Data Sets have been made available through asingle web portal.

The City strives to consistently meet the community’s expectations for excellent services in a positive and timely manner, and in full view of the public. With the advance of information technologies and the increasing ability to more easily share data across multiple platforms and online, the City Council recognizes that appropriate leveraging of these tools to make information accessible and usable by the public can help improve public service delivery and fuel entrepreneurship and innovation.Open Data is an important component of this commitment; through making its data publicly available and easily accessible, the City will empower the community to engage with government on a new level and stimulate new ideas, new services, and new economic opportunities. In addition, Open Data will provide a new platform to increase the sharing of information among City departments, improving the City’s ability to deliver services to the community efficiently and effectively. To help achieve these outcomes, this Open Data Policy incorporates best practices regarding open data from other governmental entities around the country and is informed by input received from San José residents, businesses, and non-profit organizations.## POLICY### Definitions**City Council Appointee**: The City officials appointed by the City Council to their respective offices, including, the City Manager, the City Attorney, the City Auditor, the City Clerk and the Independent Police Auditor.**Common Data Standards**: Any set of data collection standards designed to promote interoperability across agencies and organizations and facilitate the efficient exchange and use of information collected in different systems.**Data**: Structured information.**Dataset**: A collection of data presented in tabular or non-tabular form.**Data Source**: A system, database, or other information source that contains and reports raw data.**Information Lifecycle**: The stages through which information passes, typically characterized as creation or collection, processing, dissemination, use, storage, and disposition.**Interoperability**: The ability of different information technology systems, software and data applications to communicate and exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged.**Metadata**: Data that describes a dataset. Metadata summarizes basic information about a dataset, such as the date range covered by a dataset, a description of the dataset, the manager or steward of the dataset, etc.**Open Data**: Data made open and freely available to the public to be republished, manipulated, or used in any other way without restriction.**Open Data Portal**: A single web portal maintained by or on behalf of the City that will be the repository and public access point for the City’s Open Data and will include features that facilitate comments and questions from the public. The internet site is currently located at http://data.sanjoseca.gov.### Policy Objectives SummaryIt is the policy of the City that the data it collects and generates will, subject to the limitations of this Policy, be open by default. Over time and to the extent practicable, the City will publish all appropriate datasets and associated metadata on the City’s Open Data Portal, except where the posting of such data would be in violation of the Open Data Standards set forth below. Every reasonable effort will be made to frequently update datasets on the Open Data Portal to the extent that the City regularly maintains or updates such data.New information systems should, to the extent practicable, have the ability to report data in a manner consistent with the open data standards outlined in the Open Data Standards section below. When updating existing legacy information technology systems, the City will make a reasonable effort to ensure that such systems have the ability to report data in a way that meets the Open Data Standards of this Policy.To facilitate the collection, opening, and analysis of additional data and information assets, to the extent practicable, the City will endeavor to acquire rights to the data generated by the City’s vendor or other third parties where the information collected has the potential to inform operational decision making and public policy. This may include, but is not limited to, provisions within agreements with third parties to ensure the City retains ownership of its data and the ability to make such data public, and provisions to acquire data owned and collected by vendors and contractors related to services provided to or on behalf of the City of San José.In an effort to maximize the impact of this Policy, the City will endeavor to engage and share datasets with other local, regional, and national government entities, non-profit groups, businesses and community interest groups and stakeholders as appropriate with the goal of maximizing the flow of information to the community.### ApplicationThis Policy primarily applies to the departments and offices under the supervision of the City Manager. The City Manager will establish and maintain procedures to assist departments and offices under the City Manager’s purview in implementing this Policy. To the extent that the offices under the supervision of the other City Council Appointees generate or collect data that is subject to this Policy, the applicable Council Appointee will establish procedures implementing this Policy. As the management of the Open Data Portal is under the purview of the City Manager, the City Manager and the other City Council Appointees will work cooperatively on procedures for transmitting and posting data to the Open Data Portal.### Open Data StandardsTo promote government efficiency and the social good that can be gained from opening government data to the public, the default state of new and updated information resources should, to the extent practicable, be open and machine readable. City information should be managed as an asset throughout its lifecycle to promote interoperability and openness, and, wherever possible, subject to the limitations of this Policy, to ensure that data is released to the public in ways that make the data easy to find, accessible, and usable by the public. This Policy excludes the posting of data to the Open Data Portal where the public release of such data would be in violation of the law, including laws governing privacy or privileged information, or would violate contractual or proprietary rights or would jeopardize the security of individuals or property.When designing new information collection and creation efforts, the City should support downstream interoperability between information systems and dissemination of information to the public, as appropriate, without the need for retrofitting. This includes consideration and consultation of key target audiences for the information when determining format, frequency of update, and other information management decisions.Specifically, to the extent practicable, the City will strive to incorporate the following requirements into future information collection and creation efforts:**Use machine-readable and open formats**: The City should use machine-readable and open formats for information as it is collected or created. While information should be collected electronically by default, machine-readable and open formats must also be used in conjunction with electronic, telephone, or paper-based information collection efforts to promote public accessibility. Departments should prioritize the use of open formats that are non-proprietary, publicly available, and that place no restrictions upon their use.**Use data standards**: Where common data standards are defined within and by the City the City should use such common data standards in the collection and creation of information to promote data interoperability and openness, regardless of format or purpose.**Ensure information stewardship through the use of open licenses**: The City should apply open licenses to information as it is collected or created to ensure that as data is made public, there are no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, adapting, or otherwise using the information for non-commercial or commercial purposes. When information is acquired or accessed by the City through performance of an agreement, the agreement’s provisions should reflect these objectives while recognizing that contractors may have proprietary interests in such information, and that protection of such information may be necessary to encourage qualified contractors to participate in and apply innovative concepts to the City’s programs.**Ensure frequent updates**: The City should provide updates to data hosted on the Open Data Portal to the extent that the data is regularly maintained or updated.**Metadata requirements**: The City should provide the following metadata for all datasets hosted on the Open Data Portal:- Name of primary department responsible for maintaining the dataset- Name of the dataset owner in the Department where the dataset originates- Frequency of data refresh- Date and time of last refresh- Clear data labels and explanations for each data field- Additional information as necessaryData posted to the Open Data Portal will meet the following criteria:- Readable, indexable, and electronically searchable by commonly used Internet search applications.- Platform independent and machine readable.- Available to the public free of charge.- Retains the data definitions and structure present when the data was compiled, if applicable.### Prioritization for Posting to the Open Data PortalGiven that the City collects and manages a wide array of data, and that it will take time and resources for the publishing of datasets on the Open Data Portal, each City Council Appointee will establish an internal process to prioritize the posting of data within each Council Appointee’s purview to the Open Data Portal. Amongst other criteria, the prioritization process should take into account interest in particular data sets expressed by the City Council and the community, each Council Appointee’s perspective as to what degree the posting of data would improve transparency and public service delivery, the relative accuracy of datasets, and any technical challenges in the transmittal of data to the Open Data Portal. A final ranking list will be developed based on the evaluation of each dataset against the criteria, subject to modification in the applicable Council Appointee’s discretion to modify the ranking as conditions change.### Status Updates on Open Data PostingThe City Manager will issue an annual report to the City Council regarding the state of the Open Data Portal, including the number, quality, and description of datasets and visualizations posted. The City Manager will also maintain an up-to-date performance dashboard, on the Open Data Portal or other similarly accessible website, to monitor progress toward specified goals around transparency, accessibility, and usability of data.### Technology StandardsNew information systems will, to the extent practicable, have the ability to report data in a manner consistent with the open data standards outlined in the Open Data Standards section of this Policy. When updating existing legacy computer systems, the City will endeavor to ensure that such systems have the ability to report data in a way that meets the open data standards as outlined in the Open Data Standards section of this Policy, unless to do so would be impracticable, result in extraordinary cost, loss of operational efficiency, or would otherwise significantly impede normal business operations.### Procurement Incentives for the Acquisition of New SystemsOn a case by case basis, to facilitate the acquisition of computer systems that meet the Open Data Standards of this Policy, the evaluation criteria developed for procuring such system will incorporate additional consideration for meeting these standards.### Terms of UseData made available on the Open Data Portal is provided only to promote the general welfare. The City is not assuming, nor is it imposing on its officers or employees, an obligation for breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims that such breach caused injury. Data on the Open Data Portal is provided on an “as is” basis, and for informational purposes only. The City reserves the right to discontinue availability of content on the Open Data Portal at any time and for any reason.The City makes no warranty, representation or guaranty of any type as to the content, accuracy, timeliness, completeness or fitness for any particular purpose or use of any data provided on such portal; nor shall any such warranty be implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The City assumes no liability for (i) any errors, omissions or inaccuracies in the data provided on the Open Data Portal regardless of how caused; or (ii) any decision made or action taken or not taken by anyone using or relying upon such data; or (iii) any virus or other damage to any computer that might occur during or as a result of accessing the Open Data Portal or the Data provided on the Open Data Portal.The City Manager will develop terms of use for the Open Data Portal and all data contained on such portal subject to the legal review and approval of the City Attorney."

Open Data Program Goals The Open Data Program exists explicitly to: A. Improve public understanding of City operations and other information concerning their communities. B. Generate economic opportunity for individuals and companies that benefit from the knowledge created by Open Data. C. Empower City employees to be more effective, better coordinated internally, and identify opportunities to better serve the public. D. Encourage the development of innovative technology solutions that improve quality of life. Section 1: Open by Preference A. The City of Seattle and parties acting on its behalf shall proactively make City data holdings available and shall make the information available through the City’s Open Data Open Data Policy V1.0 February 1, 2016 3 Portal, subject to the limitations outlined in this policy and the operating procedures of the Open Data Program.

Through this program, the public as well as internal departments and bureaus, will have faster and easier access to data and information via an online portal. The city recognizes that making data available in this way increases civic engagement, internal efficiencies, and transparency, while also fostering communication. It is also anticipated that this will improve government efficiency for the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) officer and various staff who must satisfy FOIL requests. Data will be gradually released in a responsible manner, consistent with relevant public records law, and in consultation with the appropriate department heads. The information will be released in machine-readable formats.

The basis for this recommendation is that open data initiatives improve transparency, deepen trust between government and citizens, and lead to improved use of data for both private and public sector stakeholders. </p><p>STRATEGIC POLICY PRIORITY:</p><p>Encourage and promote an efficient and effective government, which is fiscally sustainable and guided by engaged residents.</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>The City has a decade-long history of sharing data with the public through its websites such as Cityoffacoma.org, GovME.org and TacomaCrime.org.</p><p>In August 2014, the City launched a pilot initiative to publish larger volumes of data directly to the public using cloud-based software services. The City's open data portal, TacomaData.org, has become an effective means for proactively sharing valuable information, including public safety and infrastructure data, with the public. Since 2014, staff from several City departments has published 70 unique datasets. TacomaData received over 600,000 page views in 2015.</p><p>In an effort to improve the City's practices for open data, the City applied in June 2015 to participate in the Bloomberg Philanthropies' What Works Cities Initiative to accelerate the use of data and evidence to engage the community, make government more effective, and improve people's lives. Tacoma was selected to participate as one of one hundred cities to receive technical assistance from the Sunlight Foundation, John Hopkins University's Center for Government Excellence, and the Harvard Kennedy School.</p><p>Based on an on-site workshop and self-assessment, What Works Cities and Tacoma's executive leadership team identified two focus areas for the partnership: performance management and open data. Staff has worked with What Works Cities team members over the past several months to draft open data policies and procedures designed to improve Tacoma's ability to respond to data requests from residents, departments, and non-governmental organizations, and to improve the use of data assets.</p><p>ISSUE:</p><p>In order to build on recent successes and to formalize the City's ongoing commitment to proactively publish data, staff proposes the establishment of an open data initiative. The goals of the open data initiative are to increase transparency and engagement, to improve accountability, and to enhance service delivery. The objective is to publish high value datasets for the public without compromising sensitive or confidential information.</p><p>The initiative would be designed to:</p><p>(1) <span class=g-open-formats><span class=g-thoughtful-formats><span class=g-open-access><span class=g-license-free>Proactively release high value city data, making it freely available in open formats with no restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users and uses;</span></span></span></span></p><p>(2) Encourage optimal use of data by maintaining descriptors that define the published data, and by keeping datasets as current and consistent as possible;</p><p>(3) Establish and maintain an open data web portal that provides a central location for published city data;</p><p>(4) Minimize limitations on disclosure of public information while appropriately safeguarding sensitive or confidential information; and</p><p>(5) Encourage innovative and productive use of the city's published data</p><p>ITD proposes to manage this initiative through an open data governance board, comprised of City staff members from various departments to plan, execute, and monitor the open data initiative and to produce an annual progress report, via the City Manager, for Council.</p><p>ALTERNATIVES:</p><p>The City Council may choose not to adopt the open data resolution at this time and may direct the City Manager to either continue or modify the City's current open data pilot. The recommended resolution is the best alternative to foster efficient and effective government by collecting and publishing open data and making it easily accessible to engaged residents and stakeholders.</p><p>RECOMMENDATION:</p><p>ITD recommends that Council approve an open data resolution to affirm the City's commitment to proactively publish data related to City operations and performance.</p><p>FISCAL IMPACT:</p><p>Existing City software tools and services would suffice the recommended solution. Such software tools and services are currently budgeted through the 2015-2016 biennium in Fund 5800.</p><p><p>RESOLUTION NO. 39378 REQUESTED BY MAYOR STRICKLAND</p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>A RESOLUTION relating to governmental transparency, reaffirming the City’s commitment to promote an efficient, collaborative open government with an Open Data Initiative for timely and consistent publication of public information that fosters accountability and responsiveness.</span></p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS the City is committed to engaging the community and improving public knowledge of City operations, and</span></p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS access to public information promotes a higher level of civic engagement and allows citizens to provide valuable feedback to government officials regarding local issues, and</span></p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS, by consistent and timely sharing of data, the City seeks to develop economic opportunities and increased civic engagement for its citizens,</span> and</p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS information technologies, including web-based and other internet applications and services, are an essential means for open government and good government, generally, and</span></p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS the City is committed to leveraging technology to respond to public needs and service requests, and has launched TacomaFIRST 311, TacomaData, and other applications in this regard, and</span></p><p><span class=g-proactive-release><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS, in commitment to the spirit of open government, the City considers public information to be open by default and proactively publishes high value, publicly disclosable data</span></span>, and</p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS <span class=g-sensitive-information>the protection of privacy, confidentiality, and security must be maintained as a paramount priority while also advancing governmental transparency and accountability through open data, </span>and</span></p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS a comprehensive open data program enhances coordination and efficiencies between City departments and partner organizations, and</span></p><p><span class=g-goals-and-values>WHEREAS the development of an Open Data Initiative improves transparency, access to public information, and improved governmental performance; Now, Therefore,</span></p><p>BE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF TACOMA:</p><p>Section 1.

The District government has made great Strides in achieving this goal, but we can do more, and this Memorandum outlines the approach to achieving increased openness by requiring agency transparency plans, increasing public participation in the activities of government, and improving collaboration both within and outside of government. This approach is not only consistent with Commitments made during my Mayoral campaign, but is similar to that taken by the federal government in its efforts to strengthen democratic principles and increase citizen participation in government.<em>Improving government transparency.</em> Transparency encourages accountability, informs residents of the operations of government, and increases the confidence of the public in the integrity of their government. The District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act states that it is the public policy of the District of Columbia that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and employees. To that end, the policy is that the law be construed with the view toward expansion of public access and the minimization of Costs and time delays to persons requesting information. My Administration will ensure that information is disclosed, consistent with law and policy, promptly and in a manner or medium that is useful to the public. Responsible officials must actively encourage that records exempt from mandatory disclosure be made available as a matter of discretion when disclosure is not prohibited by law or harmful to the public interest. Moreover, the government must continue to proactively provide information to citizens, thereby reducing the need for information requests, and Continue its efforts to modernize and streamline document production processes through electronic means and in a manner designed to increase efficiency, accountability and reduce time and cost,<em>Increasing participation of the public in government decisions.</em> Our government model is built upon public participation, including public hearings, public meetings, and public comments during the formulation of rules and legislation. Open government is based upon the theory that in a democracy, the more people that are involved the better the result. To implement this policy, department and agency heads should solicit public input on how the participation and engagement of the public in government decisions can be increased. Methods of Solicitation should include the use of appropriate technology designed to elicit responses. If the government is to be responsive and accountable to its citizens, it must be participatory and promote democracy in its governing processes,<em>Increasing collaboration to improve government decisions.</em> Collaboration, like participation, increases the number of voices, experience and expertise at the table, and encourages Cooperation among the Coordinate branches of government, executive and independent government agencies, and with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private Sector. Executive agencies should Solicit input from the public on how to increase and improve opportunities for cooperation and collaboration in government.I direct that the City Administrator, in coordination with the Chief Technology Officer coordinate the development of executive department and agency head recommendations on improving transparency, participation and collaboration in governmental actions. Within 120 days of the date of this Memorandum, the City Administrator shall issue a directive instructing executive departments and agencies on specific actions to be taken to implement the principles outlined in this Memorandum.This Memorandum is not intended to, and does not create, any right or benefit, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the District government, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.This Memorandum shall be published in the District of Columbia Register."

Adopt Resolution 13-95 (Attachment 1) establishing the City’s open data framework</p> <p>2. Adopt the attached draft Open Data Policy</p> <p>3. Approve and authorize the Mayor to execute a one year contract with Socrata to implement and host the City’s open data website in substantially the form attached to this report.</p> <p>BACKGROUND</p> <p>The idea behind open data is simple: any information collected and owned by the government should be made freely available for use, reuse and redistribution by the public. Open data initiatives are transforming the way governments across the country interact with their communities and are promoting civic engagement through transparency and accountability.</p> <p>Open data is much more than just making data available to the public; it’s about transforming the way we think about data, how it’s collected, used, published, and maintained. It’s a unique opportunity to look at the data we have and realize that this data could be utilized outside of the walls of City Hall to help solve problems for both the City and its constituents. It’s about putting the data in the hands of the citizens, developers, entrepreneurs and letting them analyze and visualize the data for their own needs and purposes.</p> <p>While the movement towards open data is widespread, there are only a handful of local municipalities across the country that actually have an open data strategy in place. This includes major cities such as San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, which are already seeing the benefit of open data through the reduction in number of record act requests, an explosion of mobile apps utilizing City data to help the public, and a general increase in civic engagement.</p> <p>There are hundreds of applications that utilize open data to provide value to the community. In New York, taxi cab drivers can now use that city’s open data platform to access information about the status of their licenses more quickly than ever, which keeps more taxis on the road. Cook County Illinois has a budget transparency application called “Look at Cook,” which allows community members to explore the County’s budget to see for themselves how their tax dollars are being spent. The San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department has produced a mobile application that allows users to find just the amenity they are looking for, from museums to dog parks, and to display them on a GPS-enabled mobile map. The possibilities are endless.</p> <p>ANALYSIS</p> <p>The innovative uses of open data in the cutting-edge cities above are based on a common set of practices that the City can emulate as it begins to develop its own open data initiative. In order to have a successful open data program, the City will need to establish the following items:</p> <p>Open Data Policy</p> <p>Open Data Advisory Group</p> <p>Open Data Portal</p> <p>Open Data Policy</p> <p>The City will need to create an open data policy that outlines what data sets should be made public, how to make the data sets available, and how to maintain the data sets. Attachment 2 is a draft of such a policy. Initial efforts should focus on publishing data that is beneficial and for which there is public demand. The data the City publishes should help increase the City’s accountability, efficiency, responsiveness and/or delivery of services. The data should also help improve public knowledge of the City and its operations, further the mission of the City, and/or creates economic opportunity.</p> <p>Open Data Advisory Group</p> <p>The City will need to establish an open data advisory group, with representatives from each department, to help implement and determine the following based on the framework of the City’s open data policy:</p> <p>Identify data sets that are already available, and who they are maintained by</p> <p>Prioritize datasets based on levels of public interest and the value of the data to the community</p> <p>Review the data for accuracy, and when appropriate have the data cleaned and confidential information redacted.</p> <p>Modification of the open data policy, as needed, to ensure alignment with the City’s open data goals.</p> <p>Open Data Portal</p> <p>A key component of any open data project is the data portal. The data portal will be the conduit for delivering data sets to the public. The data portal should accomplish the following objectives:</p> <p>All data sets published shall use a format that permits processing of the data through an automated programming interface (API).</p> <p>Use appropriate technology to notify the public of updates to the data</p> <p>All data sets should be accessible to external search capabilities, such as Google, etc.</p> <p>Provide an online forum to solicit feedback from the public and to encourage public discussion on open data policies and data set availability. This feedback will then be used by the open data advisory group to guide future open data set additions.</p> <p>Open data is a relatively new area of technology and the playing field is relatively small when it comes to options for publishing data. There are three viable alternatives when it comes to creating an open data portal:</p> <p>1. Build in-house with existing development staff using open source technology (such as CKAN or DKAN).</p> <p>2. Hire a consultant to develop the open data platform that is then maintained in-house on City servers.</p> <p>3. Purchase a subscription with a leading Open Data platform provider to host, serve, sync and visualize City data.</p> <p>While options 1 and 2 are viable, they eventually become a drain on City resources. The upfront cost for these options are high, due to the staff time needed and/or cost of the consultant to implement; implementation and go-live will also take longer due to extended development time.</p> <p>Staff recommends Option 3. This approach provides the fastest path to implementation, because the City would be utilizing a system already in place, which eliminates development time. It also decreases internal support costs because tech support, upgrades and improvements to the system are provided by the vendor.</p> <p>Staff researched various open data vendors (i.e. hosted CKAN, Junar, Socrata, etc.) looking for the most attractive combination of price point, implementation time frame, and software feature set. Based on this research, Socrata is clearly the leader. Chicago, San Francisco, and New York all use Socrata for their open data portals. Socrata focuses on letting the user view and manipulate the data online. Users also have the option of downloading the data is various formats (csv, excel, xml, etc.) Socrata’ system also adheres to the data portal objectives outlined above. Each data set published or each custom data view created is available via an API, which make processing this information by outside developers easier and efficient.</p> <p>Open data is the future and by approving resolution 13-95 and partnering with Socrata, the City will take its first steps in becoming a leader in open data in the Sacramento Region. .</p> <p>Strategic Plan Integration</p> <p>The recommended actions support the City’s goal of “Municipal/Technology Innovations” by making City data more transparent and open to our community.</p> <p>Alternatives</p> <p>The options are discussed in some detail in the Analysis section of the report. The Council could choose to move forward with staff’s recommendation, ask for more information or delay the project.</p> <p>Coordination and Review</p> <p>Research for this report was conducted by IT staff. Staff in other departments was also consulted.</p> <p>Budget/Cost Impact</p> <p>The $19,997 contract can be accommodated in the IT budget and therefore there will be no additional fiscal impact to the existing budget.</p> <p>ATTACHMENT</p> <p>1.

This includes commitments to simplify access to information about county services and to proactively provide easily understandable analysis of that information where possible.  The Open Data Policy outlines the steps the County will take to establish and maintain an open data program that responsibly advances transparency and accountability, connects with the community, and improves public services.## Section 1: DefinitionsA.      **“Data”** means statistical, factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that is maintained or created by or on behalf of a County agency. This definition is inclusive of software source code developed or maintained by or on behalf of the County.B.      **“Dataset”** means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.C.      **“Legal encumbrance”** includes federal copyright protections and other, non-statutory legal limitations on how or under what conditions a dataset may be used. This definition is also inclusive of any software source code made available online (“open source software”).D.      **“Open data”** means data that is available online, in an open format, with no legal encumbrances on use or reuse, and is available for all to access and download in full without fees or a requirement of registration.E.      **“Open format”** means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machine-readable data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis and search capabilities.F.      **“Protected information”** means any dataset or portion thereof to which an agency may deny access pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes or any other law or rule or regulation.G.      **“Publishable data”** means data which is not protected or sensitive and which has been prepared for release to the public.H.      **“Sensitive information”** means any data which, if published by the County online, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data.## Section 2: Open Data ProgramA.      The County commits to develop and implement practices that will allow it to:a.      Proactively release all publishable County data, making it freely available in appropriately varied and useful open formats, using an open license with no restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users to use for varying purposes;b.      Publish high quality, updated data with documentation (metadata) and permanence to encourage maximum use;c.      Provide or support access to free, historical archives of all released County data for as long as practically possible considering continued relevance of the data, record retention requirements, and cost.d.      Measure the effectiveness of datasets made available through the Open Data Program by connecting open data efforts to the County’s programmatic priorities;e.      Minimize limitations on the disclosure of public information while appropriately safeguarding protected and sensitive information; andf.      Support innovative uses of the County’s publishable data by agencies, the public, and other partners.g.

The development and implementation of these practices shall be overseen by the Open Data Team.C.      The requirements of this policy shall apply to any County department, office, administrative unit, commission, board, advisory committee or other division of County government (“agency”), including data that may be received from third party agency contractors that can be considered public information and is not otherwise use restricted, where applicable.D.      Appropriate funding shall be made available to achieve the goals of this program.## Section 3: GovernanceA.      Implementation of the Open Data Program will be overseen by the Open Data Team, which will work with the County’s departments and agencies to:a.      Identify and publish appropriate contact information for a lead open data coordinator for each County agency who will be responsible for managing that agency’s participation in the Open Data Program;b.      Oversee the creation of a comprehensive inventory of datasets held by each County agency which is published to the central open data location and is regularly updated;c.      Develop and implement a process for determining the relative level of risk and public benefit associated with potentially sensitive, non-protected information to decide whether and how to publish it;d.      Develop and implement a process for prioritizing the release of datasets which considers new and existing signals of interest from the public (such as the frequency of public records requests), the County's programmatic priorities, existing opportunities for data use in the public interest, cost, and potential positive and negative consequences.e.      Proactively consult with members of the public, agency staff, journalists, researchers, and other stakeholders to identify the datasets which will have the greatest benefit to County residents if published in a high-quality manner;f.      Establish appropriate data security procedures for the open data project and processes for publishing datasets to the central open data location, including processes for ensuring that datasets are high quality, up-to-date, are in use-appropriate formats, and exclude protected and sensitive information;g.      Ensure that appropriate metadata is provided for each dataset to facilitate its use;h.      Develop and oversee a routinely updated, public timeline for new dataset publication;i.      Make recommendations for historical document inclusion and define a schedule for approved historical document publication; andj.      Ensure that published datasets are available for bulk download and/or available via public application programming interfaces (APIs) without legal encumbrance.B.      To increase and improve use of the County’s open data, the Open Data Team will actively encourage agency and public participation through providing regular opportunities for feedback and collaboration.## Section 4: Central Online Location for Published DataA.      The County will create and maintain a publicly available location on the County's website or in another suitable online location where the County’s published data will be available for download.B.      Published datasets shall be placed into the public domain. Dedicating datasets to the public domain means that there are no restrictions or requirements placed on use of these datasets.C.      Each published dataset should be associated with contact information for the appropriate manager of that dataset as well as with a file layout or data dictionary that provides information about field labels and values.## Section 5: Open Data Report and ReviewA.      Within one year of the effective date of this policy, and thereafter no later than June 30 of each year, the Open Data Team shall publish an annual Open Data Report. The report shall include an assessment of progress towards achievement of the goals of the County’s Open Data Program, an assessment of how the County’s open data work has furthered or will further the County’s programmatic priorities, and a description and publication timeline for datasets envisioned to be published by the County in the following year.B.      During the review and reporting period, the Open Data Team should also make suggestions for improving the County’s open data management processes to ensure that the County continues to move towards the achievement of the policy’s goals."
